## About

This is a work in progress presonal project designed to help universities admit students and faculty, while assigning a unique ID to each member in order to identify them.

## Future ideas for this project 💡 
In the future, I would like to implement the dropout and retire student function, as well as introduce a new feature where you can assign each faculty member a salary, each undergrad a tuition and choose its major. Finaly, a chart showing the expenses vs the revenue of the profit would be a good idea to add.
